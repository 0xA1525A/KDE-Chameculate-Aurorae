# Chameculate Aurorae for KDE Plasma

This theme is NOT mine, it is NOT made by me.\
A combination of 2 aurorae themes:

Bali's Chameleon: https://github.com/Bali10050 \
doncsugar's sumac-theme (aurorae): https://github.com/doncsugar

> Bali's chamelon is too Windowsiee and doncsugar's sumac-theme has that one ugly bottom border.
> I found both don't match my liking so I combined them, this is meant to be personal use.
> Thanks to both.
